# DaggerGpuMiner
Stand-alone GPU/CPU miner for Dagger coin

This miner does not require files wallet.dat and dnet_key.dat. Storage folder is still necessary.

Launch parameters:
1) GPU benchmark: DaggerGpuMiner.exe -G -M
2) GPU mining: DaggerGpuMiner.exe -G -a <WALLET_ADDRESS> -p <POOL_ADDRESS>
3) CPU mining: DaggerGpuMiner.exe -cpu -a <WALLET_ADDRESS> -p <POOL_ADDRESS> -t 8

Different features and optional parameters:
1) "-h" - show help
2) you can list all available devices using parameters "-list-devices -G". You can check what platform ids and device numbers they have.
3) by default GPU-miner uses all OpenCL devices on the selected platform. You can specify particular devices using parameter "-opencl-devices 0 1 3". Use your device numbers instead of "0 1 3". Also use can use parameter "-d <N>" there <N> is count of used devices.
4) if GPU-miner sees only one device, but you have several devices, try to specify platform. For example: "-opencl-platform 1".

The project supports Windows OS and Linux OS now. Mac OS is planned in the future.

How to compile the project yourself:  
The project has 3 dependencies: OpenCL, Boost and OpenSSL  
Windows:  
OpenCL SDK can be downloaded by link https://developer.amd.com/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/. Also you can try another OpenCL SDK vendors. Path to intalled SDK should be written to a new environment variable OPENCL_SDK.  
Boost and OpenSSL libraries are included by Nuget Manager and should be downloaded automatically.
